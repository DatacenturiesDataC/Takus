# Takus — Product Roadmap & Developer Guide

## Vision: Agentic Knowledge Operating System

Takus is a **local-first, AI-agent-led platform that captures workplace intent**. It moves beyond the commodity of "screen recording" to provide **Knowledge Transformation** — turning every recording into a structured, searchable, and actionable asset.

> **"Make the video unnecessary for the viewer."**

The platform is built on four pillars:

| Pillar | Role | Time Axis |
|--------|------|-----------|
| **Record** | Ingestion engine — context-aware capture with specialist agents | Present |
| **Ask** | Knowledge base — Video-RAG semantic search across all recordings | Past |
| **Tasks** | Execution layer — AI-extracted tasks with contextual video clips | Future |
| **Connect** | Ecosystem — bi-directional sync with Jira, Slack, Notion, GitHub | World |

### State Machine States

```
idle → requesting_access → previewing → recording → paused
     → reviewing → processing → uploading → complete | upload_failed
idle → reviewing  (crash-recovery resume path)
```

### IndexedDB Schema (DB: `takus`, version 1)

**recordings** store (keyPath: `id`, index: `date`):
```js
{
  id, title, date, duration, size,
  type: 'meeting' | 'screen' | 'presentation' | 'update',
  device, aiProvider,
  aiSummary,       // markdown
  aiTranscript,    // plain text
  aiVtt,           // WebVTT (OpenAI path only)
  aiDocLink,       // Google Docs / OneNote URL
  driveLink,       // Google Drive / OneDrive URL
  participants,    // [{ name, email }]
  tasks,           // [{ id, type, action, payload, contextTimestamp, done }]  ← Phase 1
  observerLog,     // { consoleErrors, networkErrors, actions }                ← Phase 1
}
```

**settings** store (keyPath: `key`): arbitrary key-value pairs
**recovery** store (keyPath: `id`): crash-recovery chunks + updatedAt timestamp

## Phase 1 — The Scribe (Record-to-Task Pipeline) 🔨 In Progress

**Goal:** Deliver immediate, tangible value from every recording by extracting actionable tasks automatically — no user effort required after hitting Stop.

### 1a. Observer Module (`src/lib/observer.js`)
Runs silently during any recording session. Captures three data channels:

| Channel | What it captures | Used by |
|---------|-----------------|---------|
| **Console Sniffer** | `console.error`, `console.warn`, uncaught exceptions, 4xx/5xx XHR/fetch responses | Screen agent |
| **Action Log** | `click`, `input`, `scroll`, `keydown` (key only, not value), `navigation` events with timestamps | All agents |
| **Network Sniffer** | Intercepts `fetch` / `XMLHttpRequest` for failed status codes; logs url + status + timestamp | Screen agent |

Privacy: input field _values_ are never logged. Only element selectors and event types.

### 1b. Task Extraction (`src/lib/ai-engine.js`)
New function `extractTasks(transcript, observerLog, type, apiKey, provider)`:

**Output schema:**
```js
{
  takusTasks: [
    { id, action, payload, contextTimestamp, done: false }
    // actions: CREATE_JIRA_TICKET | DRAFT_SLACK_MESSAGE | CREATE_CALENDAR_EVENT | OPEN_PR | LOG_DECISION
  ],
  meTasks: [
    { id, note, contextTimestamp, done: false }
    // extracted from verbal commitments: "I will…", "I'll…", "We need to…"
  ]
}
```

- Meeting → extracts commitments, delegate items, unresolved conflicts
- Screen → extracts bug report tasks with console error context
- Presentation → extracts follow-up actions mentioned by presenter
- Status Update → extracts ticket references and blocker escalations

### 1c. Tasks Panel UI (`src/components/tasks-panel.js`)
Dual-pane component rendered in the history item expansion (alongside AI Summary / Transcript tabs):

- **Tasks for Takus** pane: automated workflow suggestions (draft Jira ticket, post to Slack, create calendar event) — each with a one-click action button and a 5-second context clip timestamp
- **Tasks for Me** pane: personal follow-ups extracted from speech — each with a checkbox, note, and timestamp link
- Task completion state persisted to IndexedDB via `saveRecording()`

### 1d. History Integration
- "Tasks" tab added to AI summary box (alongside Summary / Transcript)
- Task badge on history item row showing count of open tasks
- Completed tasks shown with strikethrough; completion persisted

## Phase 2 — Ask (Video-RAG Knowledge Base) 📋 Planned

**Goal:** Let users ask natural language questions across all their recordings and get timestamped answers, not another search results list.

### Architecture
- **Embedding generation:** After each recording is processed, generate text embeddings for the transcript + summary using OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` or Gemini `text-embedding-004`
- **Vector store:** Store embeddings in IndexedDB alongside recordings (no server needed for personal use); migrate to Netlify Blobs + a vector DB (e.g. Turbopuffer) for team use
- **Retrieval:** On query, compute query embedding, cosine-similarity rank all transcript chunks, return top-k with recording ID + timestamp offset
- **Generation:** Feed retrieved chunks into GPT-4o-mini / Gemini with "answer in 2 sentences and cite your sources" prompt; source citations link to the exact timestamp in the watch modal

### UI
- **Ask bar:** Persistent input at the top of the app (Cmd+K shortcut), replacing the current hero section in idle state
- **Answer card:** Shows the generated answer + source clips (thumbnail + timestamp) from across recordings
- **Living Wiki:** Each unique query + answer is saved as a page that auto-updates when new relevant recordings are added

### Scoping Constraints
- Phase 2 requires Phase 1 tasks to be fully shipped first
- Personal (single-device) RAG: IndexedDB vectors, no backend
- Team RAG: Netlify Blobs + Netlify Functions for shared vector index

---

## Phase 3 — Connect (Ecosystem Integrations) 📋 Planned

**Goal:** Make Takus a bi-directional hub, not a dead end. Every task can be routed to where work actually happens.

### Integrations (priority order)
1. **Jira / Linear** — Create tickets directly from Tasks for Takus; bi-directional status sync via webhooks routed through a Netlify Function proxy
2. **Slack** — Post TL;DR + video link to a configured channel; urgency flag for "Blocked" updates
3. **GitHub** — Auto-open issues with bug report card and console log attachment
4. **Notion** — Push meeting notes page (already exists as OneNote/Docs; add Notion as third option)
5. **HubSpot / CRM** — Client meeting summaries routed to contact activity feed

### Identity Vault
- Secure storage of integration API keys using the Web Crypto API (AES-GCM, key stored in IndexedDB with `extractable: false`)
- Per-integration connection status shown in a dedicated Connect panel (replacing / extending current Settings)

### Netlify Build Plugin
- "Inject Takus" toggle for sites deployed on Netlify
- Enables one-click user feedback recording on any Netlify-deployed site
- Feedback recordings automatically routed to the site owner's Takus workspace

---

## Phase 4 — Advanced Specialist Agents 📋 Future

These features require Netlify Functions + AI Gateway infrastructure and are intentionally deferred until Phases 1–3 are stable.

### Meeting Agent: Semantic Diarization
- Speaker attribution using calendar invite cross-reference
- Face-to-voice mapping (local visual inference via WebLLM)
- Verbal signifier detection: "I will…" → Me Task; "We decided…" → Decision Ledger; "Can you…" → Delegate Task
- Conflict detection: surface when a new decision contradicts a past recording's Decision Ledger

### Screen Agent: Rehydratable Bug Reports
- Full DOM/AOM snapshots (not just event log) serialised to Netlify Blobs
- "Open in DevTools" button in Jira tasks: loads headless browser with exact DOM state at the moment of the error
- WebGPU / WebLLM local PII redaction: blur password/token fields in the video buffer before upload

### Presentation Agent: Ghost Producer
- Gaze correction via lightweight browser-based face model
- Auto-chaptering using OCR on slide transitions (Tesseract.js or Gemini multimodal)
- Smart camera bubble repositioning when content is detected beneath it
- Filler word detection + one-click audio polish (silence/filler removal via FFmpeg)

### Updates Agent: AI-Voiced Recap
- 15-second AI audio abstract cloned from the user's voice (Lyria model)
- TL;DW overlay: 3 bullet points on the video thumbnail before playback
- Urgency detection: "Blocked" / "Critical" flags routed with priority markers
- Automatic Slack/Jira routing based on project context detected from screen

## Known Limitations

- **Gemini transcript tags:** If Gemini omits `<transcript>` XML tags, stored transcript is empty; summary is unaffected.
- **Blob quota:** IndexedDB video blobs may fill available disk on devices with many recordings. No auto-purge yet.
- **Watermark font:** Requires network fetch of Roboto.ttf on first use; skipped with toast if CDN unreachable.
- **FFmpeg cold start:** First WASM operation takes 2–5 s. Subsequent operations reuse the loaded instance.
- **Observer scope (Phase 1):** The Observer only captures events from the recording tab's own JS context. Cross-origin iframes and browser extensions are not observable.

## Code Conventions

- No build tool — native ES modules via `<script type="module">`
- No TypeScript — JSDoc `@param` / `@returns` where non-obvious
- No framework — `innerHTML` for full re-renders, direct event listeners for interactions
- CSS variables in `src/styles/variables.css`; component styles in `src/styles/components.css`
- Security: all user content through `esc()` before `innerHTML`; no `eval()`, no external scripts beyond OAuth SDKs
- Prefer single-file changes per feature

## Naming Conventions
- `render*` — rebuild a container's `innerHTML` from scratch
- `update*` — mutate specific DOM nodes without a full re-render
- `_private` — internal helpers not exported from the module
- Event delegation via `container.querySelector()` after `innerHTML` assignment
